## 🤖 **How We Built This (HOW_WE_BUILT.md)**

We want to see *how* you work with AI, not just what you built. Include a `HOW_WE_BUILT.md` in your team folder covering any of the following:

- **Planning** — How did you use AI to plan your architecture, break down tasks, or explore approaches?
- **Model choices** — Which AI models/tools did you use for development and why? (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI, Copilot, Lovable, v0, etc.)
- **Prompting strategies** — What prompting techniques worked well? What didn't? Share example prompts that led to breakthroughs.
- **Testing & iteration** — How did you verify AI-generated code? Did you use test-driven development, manual testing, or AI-assisted debugging?
- **Challenges & pivots** — Where did AI struggle? How did you course-correct?

This doesn't need to be long — a few paragraphs with concrete examples is enough. Screenshots of prompts, conversation logs, or before/after iterations are great. This feeds into the **Quality** category when judging.

## 🏆 **Judging Criteria**

Each judge scores every category 1-5. All categories are weighted equally at 20%.

| Category | 1 (Low) | 5 (High) |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Technology Use** | Single technology/provider used | Multiple technologies (STT, TTS, LLMs, Avatars) combined |
| **Relevancy** | Not relevant for Preply or learning | Could be added to the product tomorrow |
| **Product Scope** | Addresses a niche problem | Aims to solve a global problem affecting millions |
| **Presentation & Demo** | Submitted and presented but no live demo | Live demo, great pitch ready for YCombinator |
| **Quality** | Barely working, clunky UX | Well thought-out UX, no bugs, good quality project. Includes AI Craftsmanship (`HOW_WE_BUILT.md`) |

⭐ **Bonus: Agora ConvoAI Integration** (up to +1) — Teams that integrate Agora Conversational AI earn up to 1 bonus point.

**Maximum score: 6** (5 base + 1 Agora bonus)

### Judging Panel

- **Petro** – Preply
- **Ben** – Agora
- **Max** – OpenAI
