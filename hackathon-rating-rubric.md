### Project Rules

- Projects must address a language learning use case

- Code must be original work created during the hackathon

- Teams may use pre-existing libraries, frameworks, and APIs (with proper attribution)

- Teams must submit a working demo and source code via pull request

---

## Evaluation Process

Projects will be evaluated through a structured multi-phase process combining technical review, live demonstrations, and deliberation among judges.

### Evaluation Phases

**Submission Review**
Judges independently review code, documentation, and demo videos

**Live Demonstrations**
Teams present their projects and answer technical questions from judges

**Scoring & Deliberation**
Judges complete individual scoring, then meet to calibrate and finalize rankings

**Results Announcement**
Winners announced with feedback highlights for all teams

### Scoring Methodology

Each judge scores every category on a 1-5 scale. All 5 categories are weighted equally at 20%.

- 5 (High): Best possible — see category descriptors
- 4: Strong with minor gaps
- 3: Meets expectations, solid execution
- 2: Functional but lacking
- 1 (Low): Minimal — see category descriptors

Final scores are calculated as a simple average of the 5 category scores (maximum 5 points). A bonus of up to +1 may be awarded for Agora ConvoAI integration.
